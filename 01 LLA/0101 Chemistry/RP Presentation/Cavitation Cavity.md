Cavitation is when bubbles form in a liquid and then suddenly collapse. This can happen when something moves really fast through the liquid, like a boat propeller or a water turbine. When the bubbles collapse, they make a lot of pressure that can damage things like metal or concrete. It's kind of like blowing up a balloon and then popping it really fast. Cavitation can be bad because it can cause things to wear out or break. But scientists also use cavitation to do things like clean water or make tiny bubbles for medical treatments.
