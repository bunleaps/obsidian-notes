### **1. Introduction**

Currently, antibiotics-related environmental pollution has become a major global concern; especially the abuse of antibiotics in the livestock and poultry industries (Tian et al., 2021).

Thompson et al. (2004) found plastic fragments in marine water and sediments, microplastics (MPs). Plastic fragments or particles with size less than 5 mm are generally defined as MPs, which are now considered as a new type of potential persistent environmental pollutants.

### **2. Methodology**

**2.1 Wastewater**
This study examined the characteristics of wastewater from a large-scale pig farm that uses a rainwater-sewage diversion system. The feces are sent to a composting plant or collected for fermentation treatment, followed by aquatic plant pond treatment. The wastewater contains significant amounts of various antibiotics, even after being treated. Although current wastewater treatment methods can effectively reduce the concentration of COD, nitrogen, and phosphorus, further treatment is needed to reduce the concentration of antibiotics in the effluent.

**2.2 Experimental Apparatus**
The developed SOPC system includes a stainless steel reactor with six liquid inlets that evenly distribute water streams into the [[Cavitation Cavity]]. The cavitation bubbles produced in the cavity collapse rapidly to form a high-temperature and high-pressure environment that generates hydroxyl radical $(â€¢OH)$ with strong oxidation capacity. A pulsed cavitation jet is generated at the outlets, which converges and collides at the center of the impact cavity. The collision zone increases the surface area and surface energy of the bubbles, promoting the surface oxidation reaction. The micro mixing in the collision zone increases the contact probability between reactants, and the pressure fluctuation effectively strengthens the cavitation and accelerates the chemical bond scission of water molecules, leading to increased yield of $(â€¢OH)$. 

**2.3 Experimental Procedures**
The study focused on treating wastewater to remove microplastics (MPs), using dissolved air flotation (DAF) with conventional DAF (CDAF) and modified DAF (MDAF) methods. Jar tests were conducted to remove MPs in a 50 L Plexiglass barrel containing 35-L LPBW. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) or poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (PDAC) were added as bubble modifiers for MDAF. The study investigated the influence of different operating parameters, such as pH, reaction time, and pumping pressure, on the performance of the SOPC reactor. The reactor was operated in a batch mode at room temperature, and the content of the reactor was withdrawn at regular intervals for analysis.

**2.4 Analytical Methods**
The study used a laser particle analyzer to determine the concentration of microplastics (MPs) in samples, and COD and TSS were measured using standard methods. The type of MPs was identified using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) analysis, and MNPs were counted using Nano Measurer 1.2 software. The concentration of hydroxyl radicals $(â€¢OH)$ was measured using the coumarin fluorescence probing technique. Antibiotics were detected using high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), and seven antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were identified and quantified using published primers.

**2.5 Statistical Analysis**
Statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS software (version 21.0). One-way ANOVA was employed to identify differences between replicated groups with a P < 0.05.
