7.  Planned, Anticipated and/or Possible Future Impact from your Project:
I'm excited to share that I have a plan in place for future content releases and I'm committed to growing my audience. I have specific dates in mind for distributing my leftover content, which will include posters and simple screen recording tutorials, to keep my followers engaged and build momentum for my project. My ultimate goal is to educate my audience on the importance of cyber security and the technology field, and I believe that these future releases will help me do just that.

In summary, my future goal is to keep producing high-quality content and growing my audience. I hope my content will kept spread around Cambodia. And I believe that by doing so, I can make a meaningful contribution to the discussion on cyber security and technology in Cambodia and help people stay informed and protected.
